I am a fifth-year doctoral student in the [AMSC](https://amsc.umd.edu/) program (track: applied math) at the University of Maryland, College Park. I am also affiliated to [QuICS](https://quics.umd.edu/). I'm fortunate to be advised by [Xiaodi Wu](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~xwu/). My name in Chinese: 冷佳奇.

My research focuses on quantum algorithms for continuous optimization and scientific computing. Specifically, I advocate [Hamiltonian-oriented quantum algorithm design](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~xwu/research.html), a new paradigm in quantum computation that emphasizes both provable quantum speedups and realistic hardware implementability. I am particularly interested in the following topics:

1. Theoretical foundations and designs of quantum algorithms,
2. Resource-efficient implementation of quantum algorithms,
3. Theory and software for quantum optimization.
