I am a Simons Quantum Postdoctoral Fellow at [Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing](https://simons.berkeley.edu/homepage) at UC Berkeley, hosted by [Umesh Vazirani](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~vazirani/) and [Lin Lin](https://math.berkeley.edu/~linlin/). I got my Ph.D. from the University of Maryland in 2024, where I was fortunate to be advised by [Xiaodi Wu](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~xwu/). My name in Chinese: 冷佳奇.

My research focuses on the interplay between **machine learning** and **quantum computation**. I design quantum algorithms inspired by core principles in modern ML, such as optimization, sampling, and differentiable programming. To make these algorithms practical, I build scalable and automated toolchains for their simulation and deployment on current and near-term quantum computers. Recently, I am also interested in quantum-inspired methods amenable to large-scale acceleration on today's classical processors.
