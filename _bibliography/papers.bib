  title={Quantum Hamiltonian Descent for Non-smooth Optimization},
  author={Leng, Jiaqi and Zheng, Yufan and Jia, Zhiyuan and Fan, Lei and Zhao, Chaoyue and Peng, Yuxiang and Wu, Xiaodi},
  abstract={Non-smooth optimization models play a fundamental role in various disciplines, including engineering, science, management, and finance. However, classical algorithms for solving such models often struggle with convergence speed, scalability, and parameter tuning, particularly in high-dimensional and non-convex settings. In this paper, we explore how quantum mechanics can be leveraged to overcome these limitations. Specifically, we investigate the theoretical properties of the Quantum Hamiltonian Descent (QHD) algorithm for non-smooth optimization in both continuous and discrete time. First, we propose continuous-time variants of the general QHD algorithm and establish their global convergence and convergence rate for non-smooth convex and strongly convex problems through a novel Lyapunov function design. Furthermore, we prove the finite-time global convergence of continuous-time QHD for non-smooth non-convex problems under mild conditions (i.e., locally Lipschitz). In addition, we propose discrete-time QHD, a fully digitized implementation of QHD via operator splitting (i.e., product formula). We find that discrete-time QHD exhibits similar convergence properties even with large time steps. Finally, numerical experiments validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the computational advantages of QHD over classical non-smooth non-convex optimization algorithms.},

  title={On the computational complexity of Schr\"odinger operators},
  author={Zheng, Yufan and Leng, Jiaqi and Liu, Yizhou and Wu, Xiaodi},
  abstract={We study computational problems related to the Schr\"odinger operator $H = -\Delta + V$ in the real space under the condition that (i) the potential function $V$ is smooth and has its value and derivative bounded within some polynomial of $n$ and (ii) $V$ only consists of $O(1)$-body interactions. We prove that (i) simulating the dynamics generated by the Schr\"odinger operator implements universal quantum computation, i.e., it is BQP-hard, and (ii) estimating the ground energy of the Schr\"odinger operator is as hard as estimating that of local Hamiltonians with no sign problem (a.k.a. stoquastic Hamiltonians), i.e., it is StoqMA-complete. This result is particularly intriguing because the ground energy problem for general bosonic Hamiltonians is known to be QMA-hard and it is widely believed that StoqMA $\subsetneq$ QMA.},

  title={Differentiable quantum computing for large-scale linear control},
  author={Clayton, Connor and Leng, Jiaqi and Yang, Gengzhi and Qiao, Yi-Ling and Lin, Ming and Wu, Xiaodi},
  abstract={As industrial models and designs grow increasingly complex, the demand for optimal control of large-scale dynamical systems has significantly increased. However, traditional methods for optimal control incur significant overhead as problem dimensions grow. In this paper, we introduce an end-to-end quantum algorithm for linear-quadratic control with provable speedups. Our algorithm, based on a policy gradient method, incorporates a novel quantum subroutine for solving the matrix Lyapunov equation. Specifically, we build a quantum-assisted differentiable simulator for efficient gradient estimation that is more accurate and robust than classical methods relying on stochastic approximation. Compared to the classical approaches, our method achieves a super-quadratic speedup. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first end-to-end quantum application to linear control problems with provable quantum advantage.},

  author={Kushnir, Samuel and Leng, Jiaqi and Peng, Yuxiang and Fan, Lei and Wu, Xiaodi},
  abstract={We develop an open-source, end-to-end software (named QHDOPT), which can solve nonlinear optimization problems using the quantum Hamiltonian descent (QHD) algorithm. QHDOPT offers an accessible interface and automatically maps tasks to various supported quantum backends (i.e., quantum hardware machines). These features enable users, even those without prior knowledge or experience in quantum computing, to utilize the power of existing quantum devices for large-scale nonlinear and nonconvex optimization tasks. In its intermediate compilation layer, QHDOPT employs SimuQ, an efficient interface for Hamiltonian-oriented programming, to facilitate multiple algorithmic specifications and ensure compatible cross-hardware deployment.},

  title={Expanding hardware-efficiently manipulable Hilbert space via Hamiltonian embedding},
  author={Leng, Jiaqi and Li, Joseph and Peng, Yuxiang and Wu, Xiaodi},
  abstract={Many promising quantum applications depend on the efficient quantum simulation of an exponentially large sparse Hamiltonian, a task known as sparse Hamiltonian simulation, which is fundamentally important in quantum computation. Although several theoretically appealing quantum algorithms have been proposed for this task, they typically require a black-box query model of the sparse Hamiltonian, rendering them impractical for near-term implementation on quantum devices. In this paper, we propose a technique named Hamiltonian embedding. This technique simulates a desired sparse Hamiltonian by embedding it into the evolution of a larger and more structured quantum system, allowing for more efficient simulation through hardware-efficient operations. We conduct a systematic study of this new technique and demonstrate significant savings in computational resources for implementing prominent quantum applications. As a result, we can now experimentally realize quantum walks on complicated graphs (e.g., binary trees, glued-tree graphs), quantum spatial search, and the simulation of real-space Schr\"odinger equations on current trapped-ion and neutral-atom platforms. Given the fundamental role of Hamiltonian evolution in the design of quantum algorithms, our technique markedly expands the horizon of implementable quantum advantages in the NISQ era.},

  author={Augustino, Brandon and Leng, Jiaqi and Nannicini, Giacomo and Terlaky, Tam{\'a}s and Wu, Xiaodi},
  abstract={We propose a novel quantum algorithm for solving linear optimization problems by quantum-mechanical simulation of the central path. While interior point methods follow the central path with an iterative algorithm that works with successive linearizations of the perturbed KKT conditions, we perform a single simulation working directly with the nonlinear complementarity equations. Combining our approach with iterative refinement techniques, we obtain an exact solution to a linear optimization problem involving $m$ constraints and $n$ variables using at most $O ((m + n) nnz(A)  \kappa  L)$ elementary gates and $O(nnz(A) L)$ classical arithmetic operations, where $nnz(A)$ is the total number of non-zero elements found in the constraint matrix, $L$ denotes binary input length of the problem data, and $\kappa$  is a condition number that depends only on the problem data.},

  abstract={In this paper, we identify a family of nonconvex continuous optimization instances, each $d$-dimensional instance with $2^d$ local minima, to demonstrate a quantum-classical performance separation. Specifically, we prove that the recently proposed Quantum Hamiltonian Descent (QHD) algorithm [Leng et al., arXiv:2303.01471] is able to solve any $d$-dimensional instance from this family using $O(d^3)$ quantum queries to the function value and $O(d^4)$ additional 1-qubit and 2-qubit elementary quantum gates. On the other side, a comprehensive empirical study suggests that representative state-of-the-art classical optimization algorithms/solvers (including Gurobi) would require a super-polynomial time to solve such optimization instances.},

  title={Quantum Hamiltonian Descent},
  author={Leng, Jiaqi and Hickman, Ethan and Li, Joseph and Wu, Xiaodi},
  abstract={Gradient descent is a fundamental algorithm in both theory and practice for continuous optimization. Identifying its quantum counterpart would be appealing to both theoretical and practical quantum applications. A conventional approach to quantum speedups in optimization relies on the quantum acceleration of intermediate steps of classical algorithms, while keeping the overall algorithmic trajectory and solution quality unchanged. We propose Quantum Hamiltonian Descent (QHD), which is derived from the path integral of dynamical systems referring to the continuous-time limit of classical gradient descent algorithms, as a truly quantum counterpart of classical gradient methods where the contribution from classically-prohibited trajectories can significantly boost QHD's performance for non-convex optimization. Moreover, QHD is described as a Hamiltonian evolution efficiently simulatable on both digital and analog quantum computers. By embedding the dynamics of QHD into the evolution of the so-called Quantum Ising Machine (including D-Wave and others), we empirically observe that the D-Wave-implemented QHD outperforms a selection of state-of-the-art gradient-based classical solvers and the standard quantum adiabatic algorithm, based on the time-to-solution metric, on non-convex constrained quadratic programming instances up to 75 dimensions. Finally, we propose a "three-phase picture" to explain the behavior of QHD, especially its difference from the quantum adiabatic algorithm.},

  abstract={We formulate the first differentiable analog quantum computing framework with specific parameterization design at the analog signal (pulse) level to better exploit near-term quantum devices via variational methods. We further propose a scalable approach to estimate the gradients of quantum dynamics using a forward pass with Monte Carlo sampling, which leads to a quantum stochastic gradient descent algorithm for scalable gradient-based training in our framework. Applying our framework to quantum optimization and control, we observe a significant advantage of differentiable analog quantum computing against SOTAs based on parameterized digital quantum circuits by orders of magnitude.},

  abstract={Quantum simulation is a prominent application of quantum computers. While there is extensive previous work on simulating finite-dimensional systems, less is known about quantum algorithms for real-space dynamics. We conduct a systematic study of such algorithms. In particular, we propose quantum algorithms to simulate the dynamics of a d-dimensional Schrödinger equation with $\eta$ particles. Compared to the best previous results, our quantum algorithms achieve exponential improvements in several problem parameters. We give applications to several computational problems, including faster real-space simulation of quantum chemistry, rigorous analysis of discretization error for simulation of a uniform electron gas, and a quadratic improvement to a quantum algorithm for escaping saddle points in nonconvex optimization.},

  title={Quantum algorithms for escaping from saddle points},
  abstract={We initiate the study of quantum algorithms for escaping from saddle points with provable guarantee. Compared to classical algorithms by Jin et al., our quantum algorithm is polynomially better in terms of $log(n)$ ($n$ is the problem dimension) and matches its complexity in terms of $1/\epsilon$. Technically, our main contribution is the idea of replacing the classical perturbations in gradient descent methods by simulating quantum wave equations, which constitutes the improvement in the quantum query complexity with $log(n)$ factors for escaping from saddle points. We also show how to use a quantum gradient computation algorithm due to Jordan to replace the classical gradient queries by quantum evaluation queries with the same complexity. Finally, we also perform numerical experiments that support our theoretical findings.},
